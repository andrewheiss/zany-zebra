The [US Census's American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) has a massive wealth of data at a highly granular block group-level, but getting and processing that data can be a pain. The [{tidycensus} R package](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/) makes it really easy to retrieve data from the Census's API, but we need to feed it a list of cryptic variable IDs based on specific ACS tables. Additionally, to calculate percentages within each block group, we need to grab a denominator and different components of a numerator for each variable of interest. 

This document summarizes all the variables we collect from the ACS and shows each of the components from the different tables, as well as the formulas we use to combine the different components and convert them to percentages. We also include a link to the documentation for each ACS table at [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/).

We built this list by searching through Census Reporter and {tidycensus}'s internal database of ACS variables, accessible with this R code:

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| code-fold: false
acs_possible_vars <- tidycensus::load_variables(2019, "acs5", cache = TRUE)
```

# Census geography hierarchy

But first, because I can never remember how tracts and block groups fit within the Census's hierarchy of geographies, here's a visual reminder of how the 12-digit FIPS GEOID codes work. Block groups are nested inside tracts, which are nested inside counties, which are nested inside states. ([This table](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/geo-identifiers.html) is helpful too.)

# Data cleaning

The actual data collection and cleaning is coordinated with [{targets}](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/), so none of the code runs in this document. For reference, though, here's the R code that processes everything.

All the variable names are stored in a CSV file at `data/manual-data/acs_vars.csv`. The data cleaning function uses the list of names from the CSV file to create the Census API call.

```{r}
#| code-summary: Show the first few rows of `acs_vars.csv`
readr::read_csv(here::here("data", "manual-data", "acs_vars.csv"),
                show_col_types = FALSE)
```

The actual data collection and processing happens in `R/funs_acs_data.R`:

```{r code=xfun::read_utf8(here::here("R", "funs_acs_data.R")), eval=FALSE}
#| code-summary: Show the R code for accessing and cleaning the ACS data
```
