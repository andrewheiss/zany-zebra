### `r emoji_glue(":zany_face::zebra:")`: Note on "zany zebra" project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, I used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) internal-to-us project name that won't change.

```{r generate-code-name, eval=FALSE}
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = "king county 2", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "zany zebra"
```
